  Description:
    Abstract:
      Historical census data for minor civil divisions (also known as "civil townships") in Indiana
      were provided by personnel of the Indiana Business Research Center to personnel of the Indiana
      Geological Survey (IGS). The data were joined by personnel of IGS to a shapefile of minor
      civil divisions. The historical census data consisted of population statistics from 1890 to
      2000. The boundaries of civil townships are not believed to have changed greatly during the
      past 110 years. Using these data, personnel of the IGS calculated population density for each
      civil township during census years.
    Purpose:
      CENSUS_HISTORICAL_MCD_IN.SHP was created to provide a GIS data layer of historical population
      data for Indiana, by minor civil divisions (civil townships).

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        CS18_D00_E00.ZIP was downloaded from the USCB and unzipped. ESRI ArcToolBox was then used to convert the ESRI interchange
        file CS18_D00.E00 to an ESRI coverage named "MCD_IN." MCD_IN was then converted to a shapefile named MCD_IN.SHP.
        ESRI ArcToolBox "Define Projection Wizard" was then used on MCD_IN.SHP to define the projection provided, which was Geographic
        (Lat/Long) NAD83. ESRI ArcToolBox "Project Wizard" was then used to reproject to UTM Zone 16, NAD83, and the output shapefile
        was named CENSUS_HISTORICAL_MCD_IN.SHP. ESRI ArcMap was then used to edit the shapefile, and the following fields were
        dropped from the attribute table: "Area," "Perimeter," "MCD_IN_," "MCD_IN_I," "State," "LSAD," and "LSAD_TRANS."

        Two additional edits were made to the attribute table using ESRI ArcMap. Names of Indiana counties were added to a field
        named "Cnty_Name," using the "Join" function, and the field named "Name" was re-named as "MCD_Name."

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet named "TOWNSHIP_COUNTS_1890TO2000.XLS" was provided by
        personnel of the Indiana Business Research Center (IBRC) to personnel of the Indiana
        Geological Survey (IGS). Using ESRI ArcView v. 3.2, the data in this spreadsheet was joined
        by IGS personnel to a shapefile named "MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.SHP," using the field
        named "MCDFIPS" in TOWNSHIP_COUNTS_1890TO2000 and the field named "COUSUBFP"
        in MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.

        Fields containing population data from 1890 through 2000 were re-named "POP1890"
        through "POP2000," respectively.

        Using ESRI ArcView v. 3.2, the shapefile named "MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.SHP" was
        edited by adding a field named "CalcArea." Values for this field were calculated
        using the calculator function and the following formula: CalcArea = [Shape].ReturnArea.
        Values in that field had units of "square meters."

        Using ESRI ArcView v. 3.2, the shapefile named "MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.SHP" was
        edited by adding a field named "Area_KM2." Values for this field were calculated
        using the calculator function by dividing CalcArea by 1,000,000. Values in the
        field have units of "square kilometers."

        The field named "CalcArea" was removed.

        Using ESRI ArcView v. 3.2, the shapefile named "MINOR_CIVIL_DIVISIONS_IN.SHP" was
        edited by adding fields named "POPDENS1890" through "POPDENS2000." Values for these
        fields were calculated using the calculator function and dividing "POP1890" through
        "POP2000," respectively, by "Area_KM2." Values in these field have units of
        "persons per square kilometer."
